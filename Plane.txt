Frontend Process (React)
  
    1. Advance Login/Signup system to ditech Admin automaticly.
    2. Admin can create Folder, and uploade Pics.
    3. Use a file input or drag-and-drop library (like react-dropzone) to allow users to upload an image.
    4. Build a clean UI to display and interact with the folder structure.
    5. Use libraries like Material-UI or Ant Design for a professional look.

Backend Process

    1.Receive Uploaded Image:
    Accept the uploaded image via a POST request.
    Save it temporarily in memory or disk for processing.

    2.Enhance the Image:

    Use an enhancement model like Real-ESRGAN or a third-party API to process the image.
    Convert the enhanced image into a format suitable for saving (e.g., Base64 or binary).

    3.Save to Database:

    Choose a database to store the image:
    MongoDB: Store as Base64 or use GridFS for large files.

    3.Return Response:

    Send a success response to the frontend.

Database Considerations

    1. Database Type:

    Use MongoDB for easier handling of binary or Base64 data.
    Use SQL databases for structured data and scalable solutions.

    2.Schema Design:

     two Table:- 
     1. Folders{
        "Folder_name" : String,
        "type" : String , Unique
     }
    2. Imgs{
        "Img_name" : Buffer,
        "type" : String
    }
